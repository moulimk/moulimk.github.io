    <article class="blog-journey">
      <p>
        My journey into cybersecurity started way back in 11th grade — but I wasn't even in tech. I was a biology major, surrounded by friends in Computer Science. I’d hear them talk about their lab sessions and what they coded that day. My curiosity got the better of me, so I borrowed their C++ book during summer break… and failed miserably.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        But that “failure” became my turning point. My CS friends started teaching me, and over time, I fell in love with the logic. I ended up dropping my dream of becoming a doctor — even after receiving a medical college seat — and chose Computer Science Engineering instead. At first, I was lost. But I started learning Python on my own, and then came the workshop that changed everything: <strong>Ethical Hacking</strong>.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        That workshop was a game-changer. I got introduced to phishing, CTFs, red teaming, blue teaming — and something clicked. I found security fascinating. As semesters passed, I was introduced to Cisco Packet Tracer in my networking modules. But I didn’t stop there.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        I dove deep into networking and ended up building two major projects:
        one was a <a href="https://medium.com/@taletrove18/building-and-configuring-a-soho-network-with-vlans-a7fe1c02e609" target="_blank">SOHO network with VLANs</a>,
        and the other a full-scale <a href="https://medium.com/@taletrove18/designing-and-configuring-a-large-university-network-64ef908fa3d9" target="_blank">university network infrastructure</a>.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Post-COVID, I doubled down. I used lockdown to self-study and earn my CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) — something that still feels like one of my proudest moments.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        At the end of my undergrad, I knew I wanted more. So I applied to one of the top universities in the UK for cybersecurity: <strong>The University of Birmingham</strong>. And it delivered. From pentesting and malware analysis to digital forensics and secure systems — every module challenged and shaped me.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        One project I’ll never forget was when we were asked to pick a smart device and perform a full vulnerability assessment. We picked the toughest one: the Amazon Alexa Echo Show. We broke it down, assessed its network behavior, firmware quirks, and more. You can read that deep dive <a href="https://medium.com/@taletrove18/comprehensive-iot-penetration-testing-on-amazon-alexa-echo-show-gen-1-8d9331dcf8e8" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        In our malware module, we studied how malicious code is built, unpacked, and analyzed — both statically and dynamically. That led to another detailed project where I dissected malware samples and documented the process. Check it out <a href="https://medium.com/@taletrove18/malware-analysis-static-dynamic-analysis-labs-coursework-859861a7c06" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Towards the end, we got into firmware and hardware exploitation — including UART interfaces and binary extraction. I wrote about that experience as well, and it really opened my eyes to embedded security.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        After graduating with merit, I knew my next step: going all-in on blue teaming. So I built a full SOC lab environment from scratch and started launching simulated attacks just to study how to detect and respond. That whole experience turned into one of my most-read blogs: <a href="https://medium.com/@taletrove18/building-a-real-world-soc-lab-on-gcp-from-diagram-to-defense-b170ce2013dd" target="_blank">Building a Real-World SOC Lab on GCP</a>.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        That’s my journey. And these blogs aren’t just technical documentation — they’re chapters of my growth. If you're someone just starting out or looking to dive deeper, I hope you find them useful.
